# Project proposal

* Green Sheet Ease

* Project Description:

* A mobile app that allows trade workers to update client information, job site address, job description, materials used, daily hours, and work truck mileage.

## Problem statement

* My father, who is the CEO of an electrical contracting company, often has a difficult time getting job information from his employees in a timely fashion. The company currently functions on paper logs called Green Sheets to track employee time, materials used, gas milaged, job description, client information, and job address. Often, this paper system allows for error, because the sheets are misplaced, turned in late, or not detailed enough, as in materials missing, hours not tracked properly, or missing client information.

## How will your project solve this problem

* The Green Sheet Ease App allows for immediate submission of any necessary information for billing, payroll, job management, and inventory by creating an easy user experience with timely results.

## Map the user experience

* The Green Sheet Ease app features will include:

* A home page with a sign in that allows the user to submit an email and password to access their account set up by the company's admin.

* Once signed in, the user will be able to select from six buttons:

* Materials
* Truck Mileage
* Employee Hours
* Job Description
* Job location
* Client information
* Each button populates its own page where the user may fill in the required information for each matter:

* Materials: has an inventory list of all materials to be used for the job, in which the user may enter a specific amount for each material on a Monday through Friday calendar. Below the calendar, the user will have a submission button.

* Truck Mileage: has a section where the user may enter the mileage add to the work truck. This is where the user will again be able to access a Monday through Friday calendar. Below the calendar, the user will have a submission button.

* Employee Hours: the user may enter their daily hours in a Monday through Friday calendar. Below the calendar, the user will have a submission button.

* Job Description: the user will have a text box in which they will enter any pertinent information about the job assignment and task lists with a submission button.

* Job Location: the user will have text boxes for the following:

* Title of Job
* Street
* City
* State
* Submission Button
* Client Information: the user will have text boxes for the following:

* Client Name
* Compay Name
* Phone
* Billing Information
* Submission Button
